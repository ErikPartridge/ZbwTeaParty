  		  <h4>What is Tea Party Poker?</h4>
        <p>A mock poker game to make Tea Party all the more enjoyable. For each landing* in the ZBW ARTCC, you get a card. The person with the best hand wins.</p>
        <small>* Certain conditions apply, and are listed under rules</small>
        <h4>Rules</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>The poker game starts at 1600z and ends at 2300z on Saturday, August 8, 2015.</li>
          <li>Pilots are encouraged to prefile an hour before departure with the <a href="http://vatsim.net/fp">VATSIM Flight Plan Filing System</a> to expedite the departure process.  All pilots who choose to participate are agreeing to abide by the rules set forth for this event.</li>
          <li>The game rules may be modified for clarity or other reasons without prior notification to participants. Please refer to this page for any updates.  No rules changes will be made within 48 hours of the event start.</li>
          <li>After time has expired, the winners will be the players with the best poker hands.  Refer to the table below for information regarding winning poker hands.</li>
          <li>The winner(s) of the game will be determined within 24 hours after the event ends.  The final determination of the winner(s) will be made by the Event Director.  All decisions made by the Event Director will be final.  The players with the winning hands will receive PRIZES TO BE DETERMINED.</li>
          <li> Members of the Boston ARTCC are not allowed to participate as pilots in this event for the purpose of competing for prizes.</li>
          <li>Pilot entries will be tracked by VATSIM ID, <b>NOT BY CALLSIGN</b>. The VATSIM "Who's Online" page will be used to verify pilot information along with our own parser of the VATSIM datafeed. Either <b>file or book a flight on the bookings page</b> to be eligible.</li>
          <li>At the start of the game, entrants' landings will count toward cards.  This means that a pilot can be in the air prior to the start of the event and have his/her landing count (within the confines of the game's rules). A pilot will be dealt two cards on his first drawing and one card on each subsequent drawing.</li>
          <li> Tracking of pilot cards will be conducted offline and information will be entered by designated event officials.  Cards that each pilot has in his/her possession will remain unknown to all other pilots until the event is complete.  A pilot may verify their card holdings with the Event Director (if online, he will have the callsign BOS_PK_CTR or ZBW_TMU) via private text message. All replies to card verification requests will be returned via private text message. If the Event Director is not online, the pilot should ask any controller and that controller will try to assist, workload permitting.</li>
          <li>Trading, exchanging or transferring of cards between or among pilots is not allowed at any time during the event.</li>
          <li>All flights must terminate within the Boston ARTCC's airspace.  Flights can originate from anywhere of the pilot's choosing.  A pilot will be dealt two cards on his first drawing and one card on each subsequent drawing. Since a pilot will initially be dealt two cards instead of one, a pilot will need at least 4 landings to have a complete poker hand, plus additional departures and landings to discard and draw cards as needed.</li>
          <li>For a landing to count toward a card, the flight MUST NOT terminate in the same TRACON as it started. (e.g. A flight beginning in the Boston [A90] TRACON cannot terminate at any field listed under the Boston [A90] TRACON). See the <a href="http://bostonartcc.net/pilots/airports.php?group_by=tracon">Boston ARTCC website</a> for descriptive information about the different TRACONs in the ARTCC or refer to the table below for qualifying airports.  These rules are relaxed during the final hour of the event, see rule #22 for the final hour exemption. For example, Manchester (KMHT), Concord (KCON), and Pease (KPSM), formerly serviced by the Manchester TRACON, are now serviced by the Boston Consolidated TRACON (A90), so flights from Boston to Manchester, etc., will not count until the final hour since they are intra-TRACON flights. However, a flight from Boston to Providence, or Boston to Bradley, or any of the many airports in the Boston ARTCC boundary, would count.</li>
          <li>VFR flights are permitted, with certain restrictions.  For a VFR flight to count, the pilot <b>must</b> file a VFR flight plan, either at the origination airport or while in the air, and be under ATC control, that is, the pilot must request (and be granted) Flight Following service while flying in a TRACON under Approach control.</li>
          <li> To draw a card, the pilot must land at an airport that is under Approach or Tower control.  Landing at an uncontrolled field under Center control does not qualify. See the table below for a complete listing of airports. The Boston ARTCC reserves the right to relax this rule depending on traffic and staffing conditions. </li>
          <li>To discard and draw another card, the pilot must have 5 cards in his possession and land at a qualifying airport under Approach or Tower control.  See table below for the qualifying airports list.  The pilot must discard prior to departure from an airport.</li>
          <li> If Tower service is not available for an airport in question, then Approach service <b>must be available</b> (online) for the landing to qualify for card collection.  In the table below, the TRACONs are identified, with the airports they serve listed below each.  Only the airports listed in the table are qualifying airports, even though a particular TRACON may serve other towered and non-towered airports.</li>
          <li>The Boston ARTCC does not guarantee that any one ATC position will be staffed throughout the length of the game.  Therefore, if a position has to close due to unforeseen circumstances, the landing may not count.  The pilot may choose to refile to another open facility while enroute. The Boston ARTCC reserves the right to relax this rule depending on traffic and staffing conditions.</li>
          <li>The game will use one deck of cards (52 cards) to start with. Once this deck has been exhausted, a new deck will be added.  Cards that are discarded will be placed back into the pool of available cards. (NOTE: The actual number of card decks used to start the game may be larger. This will be determined as we get a better handle on the number of participating pilots.)</li>
          <li>Refer to the table below for the order of winning poker hands.  Due to the fact that more than one deck could possibly be used in the game, a system will be implemented that will not allow a pilot to receive a duplicate card, thus preventing an "illegal" poker hand.  Should a pilot unintentionally receive a duplicate card, it is the pilot's responsibility to notify the Event Director or the nearest participating ATC immediately.</li>
          <li> Pilots may continue to try to better their hands throughout the stated event times.</li>
          <li> A pilot wishing to withdraw from the game must notify the Event Director (if online, as BOS_PK_CTR ZBW_TMU) or one of the Boston ARTCC controllers staffing a position.  The pilot's cards will be returned to the deck(s) and made available to other competitors to collect.  Once a pilot has withdrawn he can not re-enter the competition.</li>
          <li><b>Final hour exemption rule</b> - During the final hour of the game, aircraft may complete intra-TRACON flights (i.e. depart and land at different airports with the same TRACON service area).  All other rules with respect to card collection and the discarding of cards still apply.  This is only a waiver of the inter-TRACON flight rule.</li>
          <li>Pilots who have met the flight requirements and desire to receive their card(s) should contact BOS_PK_CTR or ZBW_TMU by Private Message (PM) with their CID and request their card(s).</li>
        </ol>
