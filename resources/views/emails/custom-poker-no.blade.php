<p>Dear {{$name}},</p>
<p>Upon review of your flight details for flight {{$flight}}, I have deemed that your flight does not qualify for airport poker. If you would like to book another flight and participate in airport poker, I would encourage you to read the regulations <a href="http://teaparty.bostonartcc.net/poker">here</a> prior to booking the flight.
<p>I hope this doesn't hinder your Tea Party experience-- while poker is part of the event, first and foremost it is for a great day of controlling and piloting, and we look forward to hosting you on August 8th.</p>

<p>If you feel that I have miscategorized this flight (it happens, this is a mostly automated system), please don't hesitate to send me a note at <a href="mailto:events@bostonartcc.net">events@bostonartcc.net</a></p>

<p>Thanks and Happy Flying,</p>

<p>Camden Bruno, Boston ARTCC Events Coordinator</p>
